# OutWit.Communication.Client.MMF

Memory-mapped file transport client for WitRPC, enabling high-speed inter-process communication via a shared memory region (for on-machine RPC calls).

### Overview

**OutWit.Communication.Client.MMF** adds support for using **Memory-Mapped Files** as the communication transport on the client side of the WitRPC framework. This is ideal for scenarios where the client and server run on the same machine and need extremely fast communication (for example, a host process communicating with a sandboxed worker process). Memory-mapped file (MMF) transport uses a shared memory region to exchange data, which bypasses the network stack entirely and provides ultra-low latency IPC on a single host.

Using this transport, the client and server coordinate via a common memory-mapped file name. The server creates the memory-mapped file and listens, and the client opens the same file to read/write requests and responses. This approach can achieve very high throughput since reading and writing to memory is much faster than socket communication.

**Note:** This MMF client must be used in tandem with **OutWit.Communication.Server.MMF** on the server side. Both sides should use the same memory-mapped file name to communicate. Typically, MMF transport is used for **one-to-one** communication (one client and one server process) rather than many clients.

### Installation

```shell
Install-Package OutWit.Communication.Client.MMF
```

This will also install the core OutWit.Communication.Client library if it's not already referenced. Make sure the server application references **OutWit.Communication.Server.MMF** to complete the setup.

### Usage

To use the memory-mapped file transport on a client, specify it when building the WitRPC client. For example:

```csharp
using OutWit.Communication.Client;
using OutWit.Communication.Client.MMF;
using OutWit.Communication.Serializers;

var client = WitClientBuilder.Build(options =>
{
    options.WithMemoryMappedFile("MyApp_MMF");  // use a memory-mapped file named "MyApp_MMF"
    options.WithJson();                         // use JSON serialization (default)
    options.WithoutEncryption();                // encryption can be optional for same-machine comm
});
await client.ConnectAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

// Get the service proxy as usual
IMyService service = client.GetService<IMyService>();
```

In this snippet, we call `options.WithMemoryMappedFile("MyApp_MMF")` to tell the WitRPC client to use a memory-mapped file transport with the given name. The server must be configured with the **same name** (and optionally a size, if using a non-default size). Once the client calls `ConnectAsync`, it will attempt to open the memory-mapped file that the server created and establish communication through it.

Using the `service` proxy obtained from the client is the same as with any other transport: you call methods and subscribe to events normally. The difference is entirely under the hood: requests and responses are being written to and read from shared memory.

**Performance Consideration:** Memory-mapped file transport can achieve extremely high throughput for large volumes of data because it avoids serialization over network sockets. However, it's limited to local scenarios. Also, coordinating multiple readers/writers in one memory region is complex, so the WitRPC MMF transport is best used for one server and one client at a time. If you require multiple concurrent clients, consider using multiple MMF channels (with different names for each client) or use a different transport like Named Pipes or TCP which natively support multi-client.

**Security:** Memory-mapped files are accessible to any process with the same name and proper permissions on the system. For basic security, choose a unique name that is hard to guess to reduce the chance of an unintended process attaching. If needed, WitRPC's encryption (`WithEncryption()`) can add an extra layer of security by encrypting the data written to the memory file.
